I'm not sure if I've implemented this feature in a robust way, but at the moment it does what I want it to do. Here's how it works:</p><ul><li>The text is split into lines.</li><li>Each line is checked of it starts with a <code>$</code>. If not, then the <code>for loop</code> breaks, meaning that these lines need to be at te very top to be detected.</li><li>If a <code>$</code> line is found, then a counter gets an uptick. This counter will be used at the end to return the text without the <code>$</code> lines with.</li><li>Then the code tries to split the line at an <code>=</code> equal sign, to extract a <code>key/value pair</code> from it, to be added to <code>setup_dict</code>.</li><li>When the <code>for loop</code> ends, 2 items are returned: <code>setup_dict</code> and the text starting from the line at the counter.</li></ul><p>For now, I'm using this feature to <a href="/static_site_generator/project/stylesheet_override">assign a specific stylesheet to a page</a> because the default stylesheet is centered around the <a href="/static_site_generator/">Tolkien Fan Page</a>, which isn't very interesting for these documentation pages.</p><pre><code>def extract_setup_override(text):
