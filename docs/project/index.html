    <article><div><h1>Static Site Generator Project</h1><p>The <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python">Static Site Generator Project</a> gave me the basic building blocks to create websites like this <a href="/static_site_generator/">Tolkien Fan Page</a>. I would like to <b>take it a few steps further</b> and, while doing so, I want to <b>document any features I've added</b> to it here. You'll also find a <b>To Do list</b> with features I might add later.</p><h2>Done</h2><ul><li><a href="/static_site_generator/project/escaped_delims">Escaped delimiters are ignored by the `split_nodes_delimiters` function</a></li></ul><h2>To Do</h2><ul><li>Make it possible to use different stylesheets</li><li>Maybe use a special opening symbol inside a <code>.md</code> file to tell the code a line contains specific instructions on how to process this page. That way I could simply write such an instruction at the top the file, above the title header (e.g. an instruction to use a different stylesheet).</li><li>Add indentation to lists.</li><li>Make nested formatting possible.</li><li>Add ability to format the text of a link</li><li>Add <code>*</code> as a delimiter for italic text</li><li>Make it so indentation of <code>code</code> blocks is maintained, even when the code blocks contain empty newlines</li><li>Find a way to format code blocks to its programming language</li></ul><h2>Fixes</h2><ul><li><i>2025-04-01</i> : Inside <code>text_to_textnodes</code>, delimiters were processed before images and links, which gave errors when a URL contained a delimiter like an underscore. Fixed by running <code>split_nodes_image</code> and <code>split_nodes_link</code> before the loop of <code>split_nodes_delimiter</code>.</li></ul></div></article>
