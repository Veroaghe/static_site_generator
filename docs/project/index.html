    <article><div><h1>Static Site Generator Project</h1><p>The <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python">Static Site Generator Project</a> gave me the basic building blocks to create websites like this <a href="/static_site_generator/">Tolkien Fan Page</a>. I would like to <b>take it a few steps further</b> and, while doing so, I want to <b>document any features I've added</b>. You'll also find a <b>To Do list</b> with features I might add later.</p><h2>Done</h2><ol><li><i>2025-04-01</i> <a href="/static_site_generator/project/escaped_delims">Escaped delimiters are ignored by the `split_nodes_delimiters` function</a></li><li><i>2025-04-03</i> <a href="/static_site_generator/project/setup_override">Lines starting with $ at the start of a text can be used to deliver key/value pairs for a page specific setup</a></li><li><i>2025-04-03</i> <a href="/static_site_generator/project/stylesheet_override">Using the setup override from point 2, it is now possible to assign a different stylesheet to a page </a></li></ol><h2>To Do</h2><ul><li><a href="/static_site_generator/project/indented_lists">Add indentation to lists with alternating list style-types for each level of indentation</a></li><li>Make nested formatting possible.</li><li>Add ability to format the text of a link</li><li>Add <code>*</code> as a delimiter for italic text</li><li>Make it so indentation of <code>code</code> blocks is maintained, even when the code blocks contain empty newlines</li><li>Find a way to format code blocks to its programming language</li></ul><h2>Fixes</h2><ul><li><i>2025-04-01</i> : Inside <code>text_to_textnodes</code>, delimiters were processed before images and links, which gave errors when a URL contained a delimiter like an underscore. Fixed by running <code>split_nodes_image</code> and <code>split_nodes_link</code> before the loop of <code>split_nodes_delimiter</code>.</li><li><i>2025-04-16</i> : <code>markdown_to_blocks</code> handles a <b>code_block</b>, i.e. a block that starts and ends with 3 backticks <b>```</b>, uniquely, allowing code_blocks to have code separated by double newline characters <code>\n\n</code>. However, each section was first stripped of trailing spaces, which meant that the first line's indentation of a code_block section could become lost. This has now been fixed.</li><li><i>2025-04-16</i> : Added an exception inside <code>markdown_to_blocks</code> that would raise whenever the <code>open_code_block</code> variable would be <code>True</code>, meaning that we found a block starting with 3 backticks <b>```</b> but not a block ending with 3 backticks, after the loop through all the blocks had ended.</li><li>- <i>2025-04-18</i> : a bug was found in <code>markdown_to_blocks</code> with the way it handles <b>code_blocks</b>. While no ending 3 backticks are found for a code_block, all the blocks that follow are stored in a list with the name <b>stalled_blocks</b>. Once the ending 3 backticks are found, the blocks in the list are rejoined with <code>\n\n</code> in between them. The bug was that this <b>stalled_blocks</b> list wasn't emptied after rejoining the blocks, meaning its contents would persist if there ever was another code_block with multiple sections.</li></ul></div></article>
